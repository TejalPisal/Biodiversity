# Biodiversity in National Parks

## Objective
This project analyzes biodiversity data from the U.S. National Parks Service to understand the distribution and conservation status of species observed across various national parks. By exploring the dataset, we aim to uncover insights into how species are classified, the prevalence of endangered animals, and the relationship between species types and their conservation status.

## Key Questions Explored
- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status statistically significant?
- Which species are most commonly observed and how are they distributed among different parks?

---

## Dataset Description
This project utilizes two datasets provided by Codecademy:

- **`species_info.csv`** â€“ Contains species names, category (e.g., Mammal, Bird, Plant), and conservation status.
- **`observations.csv`** â€“ Contains observation counts of species across four U.S. national parks.
